# CS 689 Assignment 2
Hello, Students!

We're getting rolling now!  This page is written in "MarkDown," which is an easy way for me to get reasonably nice-looking text to you. We will be using this for a while, so get comfortable with it.  I am hoping it will be workable.  Don't feel like you have to 

If you have a "MarkDown" viewer on your computer, you can read these files there.  Otherwise, I would suggest that you open your browser to [your GitHub CS 689 page](https://github.com/BU-MET-CS-689/), click on the "Repository" that has your name (mine is "**ImLearningDataWarehousing**")

Then click on "Assignment 2 - ETL.png"

Assignment 2 has two main parts:

<a href="A. Installations/README.md"> A: Installations and Experiments </a>

<a href="B. ETL/README.md"> B: ETL in Python </a>

Click into part A, and when you're done, part B - and we're on our way!
