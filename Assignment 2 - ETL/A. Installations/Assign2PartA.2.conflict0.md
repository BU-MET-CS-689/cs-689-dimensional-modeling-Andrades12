# Getting Started with Git
As mentioned before, you will be submitting your assignments through the Git version control system using a server called 'GitHub Classroom.'

## Accepting your GitHub Classroom Invite

I have (tried?) to send invitations to all of you with our GitHub classroom.  These will all end up getting you to a URL like [https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/32312826-bu-met-cs-689](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/32312826-bu-met-cs-689].  However, the actual invitation URL from GitHub is [https://classroom.github.com/a/qzz1XX6M](https://classroom.github.com/a/qzz1XX6M)

## The class is under [https://classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com), not regular [github.com](github.com)
As you go through the following steps, you will be flipping between github.com to create and manage your account, and classroom.github.com.  Classroom is a github 'application' and so it needs ... well, you'll see.

When you try to join the classroom, you'll be asked to sign in or create a GitHub account:

You will need a GitHub account for your use in this class.  If you have one already, especially on your BU email, feel free to use it for this class and just log in.  

## Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account or would prefer using a new one, go ahead and create account.  You should sign up at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

After you enter your information, you will get a confirmation page like this

<img src="pix/p06.48 Welcome screen choose FREE plan.png" width=320 height=250 />

Just use the free account.  After this you will get a page asking you to verify your email to continue:

## Verify your Email

As with other systems, you can only verify your email by actually receiving your email.  You will get a message like this:

<img src="pix/p07.15 Email to request email verification.png" width=250 height=250 />

Click the link to verify...

## Re-browse to GitHub Classroom and Authorize

[https://classroom.github.com/a/qzz1XX6M](https://classroom.github.com/a/qzz1XX6M)

You will now be told to authorize your account...  If you don't, this will be a short and not very successful class for you!

## Going to your repository involves a copy

## Get Files from GitHub

There is a set of files and directories on GitHub for this assignment (and others!).

The most straightforward way to get these files is to browse to GitHub and log in.  Then go to the class repository **metcs689**
