# CS 689 Assignment 2 - Part A
Hello, Students!

Part A of Assignment 2 is intended to get you comfortable with Python and some minimal operations.  Please take screen shots as you go.  Create a Word document that is in landscape format and paste the screen shots in with *comments on what you did*.

**You must learn Python on your own by reading the McKinney *Python for Data Analysis book*. We will not be doing substantial Python coaching.** These steps are simply to help you apply what you learn in the book to our tools and to the files in our GitHub Classroom
