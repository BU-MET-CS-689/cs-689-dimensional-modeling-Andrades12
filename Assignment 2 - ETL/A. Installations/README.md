# CS 689 Assignment 2
Hello, Students!

We're getting rolling with Python now!  This page is written in "MarkDown," which is an easy way for me to get reasonably nice-looking text to you.  If you have a "MarkDown" viewer on your computer, you can read these files there.  Otherwise, I would suggest that you open your browser to [your GitHub CS 689 page](https://github.com/BU-MET-CS-689/), click on the "Repository" that has your name (mine is "**ImLearningDataWarehousing**")

Then click on "Assignment 2 - ETL.png"

...click on "A. Installations"

And then click on the "Assign2Part..." for instructions on each part.

Assignment 2 has two main parts:

A: Installations and Experiments

* <a href="Assign2PartA.1.md"> A.1 Installations </a>
* <a href="Assign2PartA.2.md"> A.2 Getting Started with Git </a>
* <a href="Assign2PartA.3.md"> A.3 Experimenting with Python </a>
* <a href="Assign2PartA.4.md"> A.4 Saving files and Getting results to Instructor </a>

B: ETL in Python
