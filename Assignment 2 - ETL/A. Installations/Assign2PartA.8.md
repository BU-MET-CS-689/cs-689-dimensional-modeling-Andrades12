# Getting Your Assignments Back to the Instructor

## Open GitHub Desktop and Hide the Secret PyCharm files

When GitHub Desktop opens, pull down the Repository menu and select the "Repository Settings..." option.

It will show you the Remote repository.

Click on the "Ignored Files" tab.  At the bottom, add `**/.idea` and save.

This tells Git - every Git program you've got - to ignore those directories and any underlying files.

## Commit your changes to git *locally*

If you have had your GitHub desktop open, you may have noticed "changed file" listings changing as you work.  This is completely fine.  Look them over.  Git has collected all the changes in your python scripts, the log file and Jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks.

Look these over if you like.  If some look wrong, uncheck them at the left.  You should keep the `.gitignore` file.

Actual changes show up at the right, in a "diff" format.

Here, of course, you're seeing the changes to my instructions!

At lower left, click into the Summary and enter that you have completed Lab 2 part A.  You can put any comments you want in the description.  Then hit the "commit" button at the bottom.  It won't let you commit until you enter at least the summary.

After this, the list of changed files will disappear.

## Post Your changes to GitHub

At the upper right, you will see a "Push Origin" with a teeny-tiny arrow.

<img src="pix/teeny-tiny arrow.png" />

Click that and it should show a little activity, then finish.  It will now say "Fetch Origin".

## Take a screenshot of your GitHub Desktop

Click on the History tab and click on the top (latest) activity.  Now, take a screenshot.  It will bear some resemblance to this:

<img src="pix/History after push.png" height=350/>

## Take a screenshot of your Files in Explorer or Finder

## Copy as many lines as possible from your python session Command Prompts

Put the text into a new text file and save it.

## Create a word processing document

* Make it landscape orientation
* Paste all of your screen shots in there
* Add a comment for each screen shot 
* Tell me what you learned!

Save the word processing document with a name that contains your name and "Lab 2A"

## Upload to Blackboard

If your word processor is not Microsoft Word, please export your file to Word or PDF.

Upload the Word or PDF file to the Blackboard assignment, and also upload your text document (or documents).

Click submit

# We're done with Lab 2A!
