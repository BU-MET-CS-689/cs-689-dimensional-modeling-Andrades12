# Simple Interaction with IPython

There are multiple tools you can use for writing programs in Python.  As you have seen, you can simply start up the `python` program and enter commands and get output directly.  Obviously, you will use the `python` command to run your programs.

But let's also do some work with the `ipython` tool.  The "i" means this is a special version that is intended to run interactively.  You can run the hello program again with `ipython` if you wish; you will see the result is just the same as before.
